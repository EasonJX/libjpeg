# libjpeg
IJG is an informal group that writes and distributes a widely used free library for JPEG image compression. The first version was released on 7-Oct-1991.

The current version is release 9c of 14-Jan-2018. This is a stable and solid foundation for many application's JPEG support.

You can find our original code and some supporting documentation in the directory files. There is a Windows format package in zip archive format jpegsr9c.zip and a Unix format package in tar.gz archive format jpegsrc.v9c.tar.gz. A collection of modified versions with adaptions and error fixes for system maintenance is available on jpegclub.org in the directory support.

IJG is not affiliated with the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16).
